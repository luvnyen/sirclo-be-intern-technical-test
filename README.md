Here are a few specific notes:

## 1. Programming Paradigm - Shipping Yard & 2. Data Structure - Shopping Cart
I utilized **Java** as the programming language to implement Object-Oriented Programming concepts and data structures.

For this section, I employed **Golang** along with [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and [Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify), coupled with jQuery (for AJAX), HTML, and Bootstrap.<br>
